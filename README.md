# Sex Education

## Abstract

A React built sexual health education application for teens. The application includes a Myth Busting Quiz, a 'Did you know?' section where users can save interesting facts, and a resources page. This application was built with a mobile design first, but the design is responsive and can be accessed in all screen sizes.
